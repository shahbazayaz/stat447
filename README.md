# Bayesian Hierarchical GARCH Modeling of Tech Stock Volatility

This study presents a Bayesian Hierarchical approach to
model volatility dynamics of major and influential technology stocks using
an AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t likelihood. By analyzing
daily returns of Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and the tech
sector ETF(XLK) from January 2020 to the present, we examine individual
effects and differences in volatility between these companies and
their shared sector-specific effects. The model is implemented and documented
using Stan and R, with further model diagnostics performed on
the posterior approximations. Our results convey different volatility profiles,
with differences in baseline volatility and persistence parameters
signifying company-specific risk characteristics. This analysis provides
insights for risk management, portfolio optimization, and understanding
of tech-sector dynamics in a period characterized by market changes
including the COVID-19 pandemic and recent US market tariff impositions.
